# because they are in the chroot by default. The order in this
# variable is important : it's the compile order for the temporary
# toolchain which can be used to recook the base chroot, then all
# the wok. Toolchain is compiled this way according to the LFS book :
# First - binutils, GCC; at this point they are linked to the host system.
# Second - the temp toolchain using the order defined in this variable.
# The toolchain is cross-compiled against a self-depending glibc.
# Third - all the wok in normal order, including the toolchain packages.
# This cook order is used only if glibc/binutils/gcc/linux-api-headers
# are updated to the next minor version or more (y.x.z -> y.x+1.z).

==== Bugfixes ====

[ ] fix --undigest repository support
	[*] Check if reference repository is local or on network
	[ ] Check that various scan() usage case are fine
		[ ] get build-depends
		[ ] get reverse depends when a recook is needed (don't catch packages from reference repository!)
		[ ] cooklist generation
[ ] Fix md5um on-the-fly generation when using check-incoming)
[*] Generate cooklist properly after cook-toolchain

==== Code optimizations ====

[ ] Removing check for $UNDIGEST in scan() subfunctions - define how theses functions should act before
[ ] Don't check for repository used into update_packages_db() & erase_packages_info(); define this before.
[ ] Don't mount all theses /home/slitaz/... directories when chrooting: one is enough!
[ ] Move files related to cooking env from packages to packages-incoming (just before releasing the beta)
[ ] Use variables for most used files
	[*] cook-order.txt; wok-wanted.txt/wok-depends.txt of reference repository
	[*] cooklist, commit, broken, blocked
[ ] Rename wok-wanted.txt/wok-depends.txt to simply depends.txt/wanted.txt
[x] L407: Use fgrep here are variable subsitution are not optimize for big strings.
	> False, variable substitution is definitively better.

==== New features ====

[ ] Take advantage of --rootconfig of new tazpkg
[*] Generate the safe-wok, and optionally a tarbalized one
[ ] Rework detection of broken shared libs dependencies
[ ] Check that packages are availble before cooking
	[*] Check that repositories exists into tazpkg conf
	[*] Check that env is up to date, or upgrade, or propose upgrade if outside of chroot.
	[ ] Need to check priorities outside of chroot
[*] Generate ID of the repository.
[ ] Ensure ID is up-dated after cook operations to avoid false-changes detection.
